# MEAN_CRM

## Introduction
A simple MEAN Stack based CRM to help flesh out my own understanding of how the MEAN stack works.

## API
I'll be using a client-model interface so that the website consumes the api, making future devices easier. It also helps solidify REST principles with Express and NODEJS

###

####/API/users

/api/users post create a user
/api/users/:user_id GET get a single user
/api/users/:user_id PUT update a user with new info
/api/users/:user_id DELETE delete a user
